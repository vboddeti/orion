comment: "PCNN Full Model - Lattigo-Compatible Config (CryptoFace parameters)"

ckks_params:
  LogN: 16  # poly_modulus_degree = 2^16 = 65536

  # Lattigo/Orion requires HOMOGENEOUS LogQ (all same modulus size)
  # Bootstrap primes must be in LogP, NOT in LogQ!
  #
  # CryptoFace configuration: 16 computation levels (matching original design)
  # Full PCNN with N backbones requires same depth as single backbone
  # (backbones run in parallel, then aggregate with tree reduction)
  #
  # Configuration:
  # - LogQ: 16 homogeneous computation levels (all 46) - matches CryptoFace
  # - LogP: 3 auxiliary primes for key switching (all 55)
  # - Bootstrap restores to level 16, allowing multiple refresh cycles
  # Q[0]/Scale = 2^55/2^46 = 512 > 256 (safe for bootstrap)
  LogQ: [55, 46, 46, 46, 46, 46, 46, 46, 46, 46, 46, 46, 46, 46, 46, 46]  # 16 levels: all 46 (except first 55)

  # Bootstrap auxiliary primes (separate from main computation modulus)
  LogP: [55, 55, 55]  # 3 for key switching

  LogScale: 46  # Scale = 2^46 (matching CryptoFace)
  H: 192  # Hamming weight for secret key
  RingType: standard

boot_params:
  # Bootstrap parameters configured for multiple invocations
  LogP: [55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55]  # 14 primes for bootstrap circuit

orion:
  margin: 2 # >= 1, controls scaling range during bootstrap (not placement!)
    #  bootstrap_placement_margin: 0 # >= 0, prevents operations from outputting below this level
